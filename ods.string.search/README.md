This project defines data structures that can store strings, support prefix searches, and grow past the limits of RAM. Most of these data structures make use of data partitioning to surpass the limits of RAM. These structures are defined under src/main/java/ods/string/search/partition.

Performance metrics are run and collected into spreadsheet reports by src/test/java/ods/string/search/PerformanceReportITCase.java.
